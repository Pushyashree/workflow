            Light Electric Vehicle Utility Model to Realize Emission Reduction Potential in Germany

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                Light electric vehicles (LEVs) have emerged as a promising solution to reduce <span class="highlight">greenhouse gas (GHG)</span> emissions, especially in densely populated countries like Germany. Research indicates that LEVs have the potential to substantially reduce the carbon footprint of transportation in Germany by 2030.
            </p>

                While the potential for LEVs sounds promising, how much of it is realistically achievable?
            </div>

            <p>
                By implementing a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE), this study aims to explore the real-world adoption potential of LEVs in Germany. The DCE will present participants with various scenarios involving different vehicle options, each with specific attributes such as price, range, charging time, and safety features. Participants' choices will provide valuable insights into their preferences and the trade-offs they are willing to make when selecting a vehicle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The findings from this study will help to understand the factors that drive consumer decisions towards LEVs and identify the most effective incentives and policies to encourage their adoption. By aligning consumer preferences with sustainable transportation goals, this research will contribute to developing strategies that maximize the emission reduction potential of LEVs.

            <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>

            <h3>Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)</h3>
            <p>Three hypotheses were considered to understand the latent variables:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Environmental Concern: The five observed indicators (Likert-scale questions about environmental attitudes) reliably form the latent variable.</li>
                <li>Knowledge about Microcars: The observed indicators related to familiarity and understanding of microelectric cars reliably form the latent variable.</li>
                <li>Current Car Usage: The observed indicators about frequency and type of current car usage reliably form the latent variable.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="https://github.com/Pushyashree/images/blob/main/CFA.PNG?raw=true" alt="CFA Diagram" class="enlarged-image">

            <p>&bull; Factor loading for one variable in environmental concern was a concern and was removed to reduce the error term.<br>
            &bull; Knowledge about Micro Electric Cars as a latent was excluded due to insufficient loadings and high measurement errors, which likely indicated that the observed variables did not adequately represent the intended latent construct.</p>
            <img src="https://github.com/Pushyashree/images/blob/main/cfa_dist.PNG?raw=true" alt="CFA Distribution" class="enlarged-image">

            <p><strong>Car Usage Intensity Distribution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A cluster near "-2" represents participants who rarely or never use cars</li>
                <li>The right peak (closer to 1) indicates more frequent car users, likely regular car commuters or those who use their cars extensively for long-distance and regular commuting.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Environmental Concern Distribution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The central peak reflects participants with moderate environmental concerns, which may represent the general population's views.</li>
                <li>Participants with both very low and very high environmental concerns (tails of the distribution) ensure diverse perspectives.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)</h3>
            <p>&bull; Here, socio-demographic data was considered to identify possible latent variables. EFA for 2 factors had strong loadings of household size and children for Factor 0, suggesting this factor captures the characteristics of large families. Larger household sizes often correlate with the presence of children. The moderate loading on the presence of the youngest child in the household indicated that the child may be older in these households, as larger families tend to include children across a wider age range.</p>

            <p>&bull; The strong loading of the youngest child and the presence of children on Factor 1 suggested that this factor focuses on families where younger children are present. The lower loading of household size indicated that this factor applies more to medium-sized families rather than very large ones. Medium-sized families with a greater focus on younger children might prioritize specific child-related needs (e.g., safety or child-friendly products).</p>

            <p>&bull; Further, K-means clustering was done using defined factor scores. While considering elbow point in identifying the optimum number of clusters (k). Four clusters were defined as shown below:</p>

        <section id="model">
            <h2>Model</h2>

            <h3>Latent Class Analysis (LCA)</h3>
            <p>&bull; LCA was done to identify potential classes in socio-demographic variables. Based on the elbow point for 4 classes, as shown below, those many numbers of classes were retained for further model building with a keeping check of class definition entropy for each class was greater than 0.8 (shown in the graph below).</p>

            <p>&bull; The below four distributions show the final four defined class and their distribution of each class category identifying possible class names. Further, based on maximum posterior probabilities each individual was assigned to one of the below classes.</p>

            <h3>Latent Class Model (LCM)</h3>
            <p>Main Findings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Class 3: Pensioners in small families without children had the highest probability of buying a microcar compared to the rest of all classes defined, and they were sensitive to the purchase price, charging time, and nearby available public transport.</li>
                <li>Class 1: Mid-aged females with intermediate education in urban areas were sensitive to their car usage intensity, awareness of the electric vehicles and nearby public transport availability, and they were the second highest group to adopting a microcar.</li>
                <li>Class 2: Couples who were highly educated with employment and kids were sensitive to the purchase price and environmental concerns as these groups were highly educated, their car usage intensity and knowledge of electric vehicles.</li>
                <li>Class 4: Older people with full-time employment in small families, apart from the purchase price, charging time, car usage, and knowledge about electric vehicles, were sensitive to buying microcars and electric cars if available public transport was far further away.</li>
            </ul>
